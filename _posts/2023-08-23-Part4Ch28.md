# 4.3 Investigations



## Vulnerability Scan Output

Vulnerability scan output provides the results of automated scans that identify potential vulnerabilities in systems and applications. It lists vulnerabilities, their severity, and recommended actions for remediation.

## SIEM Dashboards

### Sensor
A sensor is a component of a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system that collects data from various sources, including network devices, servers, and applications.

### Sensitivity
Sensitivity refers to the level of importance or criticality assigned to a security event. SIEM dashboards often categorize events based on sensitivity to prioritize response efforts.

### Trends
SIEM dashboards display trends in security events over time. This helps analysts identify patterns and anomalies, leading to proactive incident response.

### Alerts
SIEM systems generate alerts when specific security events occur. Analysts monitor alerts to detect and respond to potential threats promptly.

### Correlation
Correlation in SIEM involves linking related security events from different sources to provide a more comprehensive view of an incident. This helps analysts understand the entire attack chain.

## Log Files

Log files contain records of events occurring on various systems and applications. They are valuable for investigations as they provide insights into system activities and potential security incidents.

### Network
Network log files record network traffic, including connections, sessions, and communication patterns. They can help identify unauthorized access attempts and abnormal network behavior.

### System
System logs record activities on a system, such as logins, process executions, and configuration changes. They aid in identifying anomalies, malware infections, and unauthorized access.

### Application
Application logs document activities within specific applications. They are useful for identifying application-specific vulnerabilities, errors, and abnormal usage patterns.

### Security
Security logs focus on security-related events, such as authentication attempts, access control changes, and security policy violations. They provide insights into potential security breaches.

### Web
Web logs, often from web servers or proxies, capture web traffic details, URLs accessed, and user interactions. They help investigate web-based attacks and unauthorized access.

### DNS
DNS logs record DNS queries and responses. They assist in identifying domain-related threats, such as domain hijacking and DNS poisoning.

### Authentication
Authentication logs track user authentication and authorization activities. They help detect unauthorized access attempts and brute-force attacks.

### Dump Files
Dump files contain memory snapshots or core dumps from crashed programs. They can be analyzed to identify vulnerabilities and potential exploits.

### VoIP and Call Managers
VoIP logs provide information about voice calls, call quality, and session details in Voice over IP (VoIP) systems. They help diagnose VoIP-related issues and potential attacks.

### Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Traffic
SIP traffic logs record communication sessions in SIP-based applications, such as VoIP and video conferencing. They aid in analyzing communication patterns and potential vulnerabilities.

## Syslog/Rsyslog/Syslog-ng

Syslog, Rsyslog, and Syslog-ng are protocols and software used for collecting and forwarding log messages. They centralize log data from various sources for easier analysis and investigation.

## Journalctl

Journalctl is a command-line utility for querying and viewing logs from the systemd journal. It provides information about system events, services, and kernel messages.

## NXLog

NXLog is a log management tool used to collect, process, and forward log messages from various sources to central repositories, such as SIEM systems.

## Bandwidth Monitors

Bandwidth monitors track network traffic volume and patterns. They help detect unusual spikes in traffic that may indicate security incidents or attacks.

## Metadata

Metadata is data that provides information about other data. In the context of investigations, metadata from various sources can provide valuable context and insights.

### E-Mail

E-mail metadata includes details about the sender, recipient, subject, and timestamps of an e-mail message. It aids in tracking communication patterns and identifying potential phishing or malicious e-mails.

### Mobile

Mobile device metadata includes information such as call logs, text messages, and application usage. It helps understand user behavior and track potential security incidents.

### Web

Web metadata includes information about websites visited, URLs accessed, and browser activity. It assists in analyzing web-based attacks and user behavior.

### File

File metadata includes details like file creation time, modification time, and permissions. It's crucial for tracking file-related activities and potential data breaches.

## NetFlow/sFlow

NetFlow and sFlow are network traffic monitoring technologies. They collect and analyze flow data, providing insights into network communication patterns, traffic volume, and potential anomalies.

### IPFIX

IPFIX (IP Flow Information Export) is an extension of NetFlow that standardizes flow data export formats. It provides a common way to export network traffic data for analysis.

## Protocol Analyzer Output

Protocol analyzers, like Wireshark, capture and analyze network traffic at the packet level. Their output helps investigators understand communication patterns, identify abnormal behaviors, and detect potential attacks.
