# 4.2 Incident Response Policies, Processes, and Procedures

## Incident Response Plans

An incident response plan outlines the procedures an organization follows to effectively manage and mitigate security incidents. It ensures that the organization is prepared to respond promptly and efficiently to security breaches and minimize potential damage.

## Incident Response Process

### Preparation
The preparation phase involves establishing incident response policies, procedures, and a team. It includes defining roles, responsibilities, and communication channels, as well as identifying critical assets and potential threats.

### Identification
The identification phase focuses on detecting and recognizing potential security incidents. This involves monitoring systems, analyzing logs, and using intrusion detection systems to identify unusual or suspicious activities.

### Containment
During the containment phase, the goal is to prevent the incident from spreading and causing further damage. This may involve isolating affected systems, disconnecting from the network, and taking immediate steps to limit the attacker's access.

### Eradication
Eradication involves identifying the root cause of the incident and taking actions to remove the threat completely. This could include removing malware, closing vulnerabilities, and eliminating backdoors.

### Recovery
The recovery phase focuses on restoring systems to normal operation. This includes restoring data from backups, ensuring systems are secure, and validating that services are functioning correctly.

### Lessons Learned
After the incident is resolved, a post-incident review is conducted to analyze the incident response process. This phase involves evaluating what worked well and what could be improved, allowing the organization to learn from the experience.

## Exercises

### Tabletop
Tabletop exercises are discussions involving key stakeholders to simulate a security incident scenario. Participants discuss their roles, response strategies, and decision-making processes without actually implementing actions.

### Walkthroughs
Walkthroughs involve a step-by-step review of the incident response plan. Team members follow the plan as if responding to a real incident, identifying potential gaps and areas for improvement.

### Simulations
Simulations involve carrying out a realistic incident scenario in a controlled environment. This could include simulating attacks, responses, and coordination among incident response team members.

## Attack Frameworks

### MITRE ATT&CK
MITRE ATT&CK is a comprehensive framework that outlines various tactics, techniques, and procedures used by adversaries during cyberattacks. It helps organizations understand and categorize threat behaviors to improve incident response strategies.

### The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis
The Diamond Model is a framework for analyzing cyber threats. It involves four key elements: Adversary, Infrastructure, Victim, and Capability. It helps incident responders understand the context of an attack and make informed decisions.

### Cyber Kill Chain
The Cyber Kill Chain model breaks down a cyber attack into seven stages: Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Command and Control, and Actions on Objectives. It aids in understanding an attacker's progression and identifying defensive strategies.

## Stakeholder Management

Stakeholder management involves identifying and engaging relevant individuals and groups during an incident. This includes communication with executives, legal teams, public relations, customers, and law enforcement.

## Communication Plan

A communication plan outlines how information will be shared during and after an incident. It includes communication channels, responsibilities, and messaging strategies to ensure accurate and timely communication to internal and external parties.

## Disaster Recovery Plan

A disaster recovery plan focuses on restoring IT systems and infrastructure after a major incident or outage. It outlines procedures for recovering data, applications, and services to ensure business continuity.

## Business Continuity Plan

A business continuity plan ensures that essential business functions can continue during and after a disruptive incident. It includes strategies for maintaining operations, communication, and services despite the incident's impact.

## Continuity of Operation Planning (COOP)

COOP involves planning for the continuation of critical operations during and after incidents that could disrupt normal business activities. It includes strategies for remote work, alternate facilities, and maintaining essential services.

## Incident Response Team

The incident response team comprises individuals responsible for managing and responding to security incidents. Roles within the team may include incident commander, technical analysts, communication specialists, legal advisors, and more.

## Retention Policies

Retention policies define how long incident-related data and records are retained. They ensure that relevant information is preserved for analysis, reporting, and compliance purposes while adhering to legal and regulatory requirements.
