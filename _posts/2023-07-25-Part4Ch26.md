## File Manipulation

### head
The "head" command allows users to view the beginning of a text file. By default, it displays the first 10 lines of the file, but this number can be adjusted using options. It's useful for quickly inspecting the contents of large files or checking the initial lines of log files.

### tail
The "tail" command complements "head" by displaying the end of a text file. It's particularly handy for monitoring log files in real-time, as it can display newly added lines as they are written. The default behavior shows the last 10 lines, but options can be used to adjust the number of lines displayed.

### cat
"cat," short for concatenate, is a versatile command used to display the contents of one or more text files. While it can be used to display an entire file, it's also often used in combination with other commands for processing and manipulating text.

### grep
The "grep" command stands for Global Regular Expression Print. It's a powerful tool used for searching patterns within text files. Regular expressions (regex) can be used to specify the pattern, making it incredibly flexible for finding specific strings, words, or data in files.

### chmod
"chmod" is a command that modifies file permissions in Unix-like operating systems. It allows users to specify who can read, write, and execute a file. Permissions are assigned for the owner, group, and others. For example, "chmod 755 filename" grants read, write, and execute permissions to the owner, and read and execute permissions to others.

### logger
The "logger" command is used to add messages to system logs. This can be useful for creating custom log entries, tracking events, or scripting log-related tasks. It's often used in shell scripts to provide information about the script's progress or important events.

## Shell and Script Environments

### SSH
Secure Shell (SSH) is a widely used protocol for securely connecting to remote systems over an encrypted network. It provides authentication and encryption, ensuring that sensitive data, including passwords, are protected during transmission. SSH allows users to execute commands on remote systems and transfer files securely.

### PowerShell
