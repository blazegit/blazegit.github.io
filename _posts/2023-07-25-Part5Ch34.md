# Risk Management

Risk management involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential threats and vulnerabilities to an organization's assets, operations, and data. It's a fundamental process to maintain security and minimize the impact of adverse events.

## Risk Types

### External
External risks originate from outside the organization, such as cyberattacks, natural disasters, and economic changes.

### Internal
Internal risks arise from within the organization, including employee misconduct, data breaches due to negligence, and operational errors.

### Legacy Systems
Legacy system risks stem from outdated technologies that lack modern security features and updates, making them susceptible to vulnerabilities.

### Multiparty
Multiparty risks emerge from complex relationships involving multiple organizations, vendors, and partners, each introducing potential vulnerabilities.

### IP Theft
Intellectual property (IP) theft risks involve the unauthorized access or theft of an organization's valuable proprietary information, including trade secrets and patents.

### Software Compliance/Licensing
Software compliance and licensing risks arise when organizations fail to comply with software usage terms, licensing agreements, and intellectual property rights.

## Risk Management Strategies

### Acceptance
Risk acceptance involves acknowledging a potential risk but deciding not to take specific actions to mitigate it, often due to the low likelihood or acceptable impact.

### Avoidance
Risk avoidance entails steering clear of activities or situations that could lead to potential risks, effectively eliminating the associated threats.

### Transference
Risk transference involves transferring the risk and its potential consequences to another entity, often achieved through insurance policies or outsourcing.

### Mitigation
Risk mitigation focuses on reducing the likelihood or impact of a risk. It involves implementing controls, safeguards, and preventive measures.

## Risk Analysis

### Risk Register
A risk register is a document that catalogs identified risks, including their descriptions, potential impacts, likelihoods, and mitigation strategies.

### Risk Matrix/Heat Map
A risk matrix or heat map visually represents risks based on their likelihood and impact, aiding in prioritizing mitigation efforts.

### Risk Control Assessment
Risk control assessment evaluates the effectiveness of existing controls in managing identified risks and suggests improvements if needed.

### Risk Control Self-Assessment
Risk control self-assessment involves employees evaluating the effectiveness of controls within their areas of responsibility.

### Risk Awareness
Promoting risk awareness among employees helps create a culture of vigilance and responsibility for identifying and mitigating risks.

### Inherent Risk
Inherent risk is the level of risk an organization faces before implementing any risk management measures.

### Residual Risk
Residual risk remains after implementing risk management strategies. It's the remaining risk exposure despite mitigation efforts.

### Control Risk
Control risk is the risk that arises from deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls.

### Risk Appetite
Risk appetite defines the level of risk an organization is willing to tolerate to achieve its objectives while maintaining its reputation and financial stability.

### Regulations That Affect Risk Posture
Compliance with industry regulations and legal requirements affects an organization's risk posture and risk management strategies.

### Risk Assessment Types
Various types of risk assessments, such as qualitative, quantitative, and hybrid approaches, help organizations evaluate and manage risks effectively.

### Likelihood of Occurrence
Likelihood of occurrence assesses how likely a risk event is to happen based on historical data, expert judgment, or statistical analysis.

### Impact
Impact measures the potential consequences of a risk event occurring, including financial, operational, and reputational implications.

### Asset Value
Asset value assessment assigns a monetary value to assets, aiding in calculating potential losses from risk events.

### Single-Loss Expectancy (SLE)
SLE is the estimated financial loss resulting from a single occurrence of a risk event.

### Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)
ALE quantifies the expected annual financial loss due to a risk event by multiplying the SLE with the Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO).

### Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)
ARO estimates how often a specific risk event is likely to occur within a year.

## Disasters

### Environmental
Environmental disasters include natural events such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, and wildfires that can disrupt business operations.

### Person-made
Person-made disasters result from intentional or accidental actions, including cyberattacks, industrial accidents, and acts of terrorism.

### Internal vs. External
Internal disasters are caused by factors within the organization, while external disasters arise from external factors beyond the organization's control.

## Business Impact Analysis

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
RTO is the maximum acceptable time a system can be down after a disruption before causing significant business impact.

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
RPO defines the maximum data loss an organization can tolerate after a disruption, indicating the point to which systems must be restored.

### Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)
MTTR is the average time taken to repair a system after a failure, influencing downtime and recovery planning.

### Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
MTBF is the average time between failures for a system, providing insights into its reliability.

### Functional Recovery Plans
Functional recovery plans detail how critical business functions and processes can be restored after a disruption.

### Single Point of Failure
A single point of failure is a component or process that, if it fails, can lead to the failure of the entire system.

### Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)
A DRP outlines procedures, strategies, and resources for recovering IT systems, data, and operations after a disaster.

### Mission-Essential Functions
Mission-essential functions are critical activities that must continue even during disruptions to maintain essential business operations.

### Identification of Critical Systems
Identifying critical systems helps prioritize resources and planning efforts for disaster recovery and continuity.

### Site Risk Assessment
Site risk assessment evaluates the vulnerability of physical locations to various risks and informs disaster recovery planning.
