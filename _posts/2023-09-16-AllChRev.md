# Part I: Threats, Attacks and Vulnerabilities

## 1.1 Social Engineering Techniques

Social engineering attacks involve manipulating individuals to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or perform specific actions. Attackers exploit human psychology, trust, and vulnerability to deceive their targets. These attacks succeed by taking advantage of human trust and helpfulness, as people are naturally inclined to assist others. Additionally, the success of social engineering attacks stems from people's preference to avoid confrontation and trouble, making them susceptible to intimidation tactics. These attacks combine technical elements with psychological manipulation.

A watering hole attack is a technique where attackers compromise websites frequented by a specific target group, exploiting their trust to deliver malware or gather information.

24. Typosquatting:
Typosquatting involves registering domain names similar to legitimate ones but with slight misspellings or variations, aiming to trick users into visiting malicious websites.

25. Pretexting:
Pretexting is a social engineering technique where attackers create a false pretext or scenario to deceive individuals and manipulate them into revealing sensitive information.

26. Influence Campaigns:
Influence campaigns refer to coordinated efforts, often utilizing social media platforms, to shape public opinion, spread propaganda, or manipulate people's beliefs and behaviors.

Principles (Reasons for Effectiveness):

- Authority: People tend to comply with requests from perceived figures of authority.
