# Part I: Threats, Attacks and Vulnerabilities

## 1.1 Social Engineering Techniques

Social engineering attacks involve manipulating individuals to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or perform specific actions. Attackers exploit human psychology, trust, and vulnerability to deceive their targets. These attacks succeed by taking advantage of human trust and helpfulness, as people are naturally inclined to assist others. Additionally, the success of social engineering attacks stems from people's preference to avoid confrontation and trouble, making them susceptible to intimidation tactics. These attacks combine technical elements with psychological manipulation.
