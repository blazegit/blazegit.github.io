# 4.5 Digital Forensics

## Documentation/Evidence

### Legal Hold
A legal hold is a process that ensures relevant data and documents are preserved when litigation or investigations are anticipated. It prevents the destruction or alteration of potential evidence.

### Video
Video evidence includes recordings from surveillance cameras or other sources. It can provide visual context for incidents, such as unauthorized access or physical breaches.

### Admissibility
Admissibility refers to the criteria that evidence must meet to be considered valid and relevant in legal proceedings. Ensuring evidence meets admissibility standards is crucial for its acceptance in court.

### Chain of Custody
Chain of custody is the documented history of the evidence's handling, custody, and control. Maintaining a clear and unbroken chain of custody is essential to demonstrate the integrity and authenticity of evidence.

### Timelines of Sequence of Events
Creating timelines of events helps investigators reconstruct the sequence of actions during an incident. Timelines provide a clear visualization of how an incident unfolded.

#### Time Stamps
Time stamps refer to the time data associated with specific events or actions. They represent the exact time when an event occurred and are often recorded in a standardized format to ensure consistency and accuracy. Time stamps are critical for establishing the chronology of events in a forensic investigation and for correlating different activities across various systems or logs.

#### Time Offset
Time offset is a term used to describe the difference in time between two related events or actions. It is often used to account for variations in time settings or discrepancies between different systems or logs. By understanding and adjusting for time offsets, investigators can accurately align events from different sources to create a comprehensive timeline of an incident. Time offset is essential for synchronizing and reconciling the timing of events across various data sources, especially when analyzing logs from different systems or devices.

### Tags
Tagging evidence with metadata, such as timestamps and descriptions, helps organize and categorize collected data. Tags facilitate efficient retrieval and analysis of evidence.

### Reports
Reports document investigation findings, methodologies, and conclusions. They are essential for communicating investigation results to stakeholders, legal teams, and management.

### Event Logs
Event logs record system and application activities. Analyzing event logs can reveal important information about user actions, system behavior, and potential security incidents.

### Interviews
Conducting interviews with relevant individuals can provide valuable insights into incidents. Interviews help gather firsthand accounts, understand motivations, and identify potential leads.

## Acquisition

### Order of Volatility
The order of volatility guides the sequence in which digital evidence is collected. Volatile data, such as data in memory, should be collected first to avoid data loss.

1. CPU, cache, and register contents (collect first)
2. Routing tables, ARP cache, process tables, kernel statistics
3. Live network connections and data flows
4. Memory (RAM)
5. Temporary file system/swap space
6. Data on hard disk
7. Remotely logged data
8. Data stored on archival media/backups (collect last)

### Disk
Acquiring disk images involves copying the entire contents of a storage device. Disk forensics is crucial for investigating file systems, deleted files, and user activities.

### Random-Access Memory (RAM)
Collecting data from RAM captures information currently in memory. RAM analysis can reveal running processes, open network connections, and encryption keys.

### Swap/Pagefile
Swap or pagefile analysis involves examining virtual memory files. These files may contain fragments of sensitive information that were moved out of RAM.

### Operating System (OS)
Analyzing the operating system can uncover configuration settings, user profiles, and system logs. It helps understand system activities leading up to an incident.

### Device
Collecting data from devices like smartphones and tablets is essential for mobile forensics. It involves extracting data from apps, messages, and call logs.

### Firmware
Firmware forensics focuses on analyzing the software embedded in devices. It can reveal vulnerabilities, backdoors, and potential security weaknesses.

### Snapshot
Taking snapshots of virtual machines captures their current state. Snapshots allow investigators to analyze VMs without altering the original system.

### Cache
Analyzing cache data can provide insights into user activities and recently accessed files or websites.

### Network
Network forensics involves capturing and analyzing network traffic. It helps reconstruct communication patterns, identify unauthorized access, and detect malicious activities.

### Artifacts
Artifacts are remnants of user activities stored on a system. They include browser history, cookies, and temporary files, which can provide valuable insights.

## On-premises vs. Cloud

### Right to Audit Clauses
Right to audit clauses in contracts grant the right to examine cloud service providers' security practices. They help organizations ensure compliance and security in cloud environments.

### Regulatory/Jurisdiction
Considerations of regulatory requirements and jurisdictional laws influence the handling of digital evidence. Compliance with relevant laws is crucial for admissible evidence.

### Data Breach Notification Laws
Data breach notification laws mandate organizations to inform affected parties about data breaches. Compliance with these laws is essential during investigations involving data breaches.

## Integrity

### Hashing
Hashing involves generating a fixed-size string of characters (hash) from data. Hashes help verify data integrity and identify changes or tampering.

### Checksums
Checksums are numeric values derived from data for integrity verification. Comparing checksums before and after an investigation helps detect alterations.

### Provenance
Provenance refers to the origin and history of data. Ensuring data provenance helps verify its authenticity and reliability.

## Preservation

Preservation ensures that collected evidence remains unchanged and unaltered throughout the investigation process. Proper preservation is essential for maintaining the integrity of evidence.

## E-Discovery

E-discovery involves identifying, collecting, and producing electronically stored information (ESI) as evidence in legal cases. It applies to electronic documents, emails, databases, and more.

## Data Recovery

Data recovery techniques are used to retrieve lost or deleted data from storage devices. These techniques are crucial for recovering evidence that may have been intentionally or accidentally deleted.

## Nonrepudiation

Nonrepudiation ensures that the origin and authenticity of a message or transaction cannot be denied. It prevents parties from denying their involvement in an action.

## Strategic Intelligence/Counterintelligence

Strategic intelligence involves gathering information to make informed decisions, while counterintelligence focuses on protecting against espionage and unauthorized access to sensitive information. Both are essential in digital forensics to understand the threat landscape and secure assets.
