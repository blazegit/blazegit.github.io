## Chapter 3: Application Attack Indicators

### Privilege Escalation


Privilege escalation involves gaining higher levels of access or privileges on computer systems, networks, or applications beyond the initial level. It can occur in various contexts like operating systems, applications, databases, or networks, with the aim of obtaining additional permissions, often administrative or root-level access. This practice is viewed as a security vulnerability or attack vector. Attackers can exploit privilege escalation using techniques like exploiting software vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, weak access controls, or manipulating user interactions to carry out malicious actions.

There are different types of privilege escalation, including:

1. Vertical Privilege Escalation: This involves elevating privileges from a lower level to a higher level within the same user hierarchy. For example, a regular user gaining administrative privileges.

2. Horizontal Privilege Escalation: In this case, the attacker gains the same level of privileges as the target user but assumes the identity of that user. It typically occurs when there are multiple user accounts with the same privilege level but different permissions.

3. Lateral Privilege Escalation: This form of privilege escalation involves gaining privileges within the same level <u>but across different systems or services</u>. It may happen when a compromised account on one system is used to access another system or service with the same or higher privileges.


### Cross-Site Scripting

Is a type of security vulnerability commonly found in web applications. It occurs when an attacker injects malicious scripts or code into a trusted website or web application, which is then executed by a victim's browser. The vulnerability typically arises due to insufficient input validation or sanitization of user-supplied data that is displayed on a web page.

There are three main types of XSS attacks:

1. Stored XSS: The malicious script is permanently stored on the target server and is served to users when they visit a specific web page. This type of XSS attack can impact multiple users who view the compromised content.

2. Reflected XSS: The malicious script is embedded in a URL or a link and is only triggered when a user clicks on that specially crafted link. The injected script is then reflected back in the response, executing in the user's browser.

3. DOM-based XSS: This type of XSS attack occurs when the vulnerability is present in the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page. The malicious script manipulates the DOM environment, leading to unauthorized actions or information disclosure.

4. Non-persistent XSS: The injected script is not persisted or stored but rather is immediately executed and passed back via the web server.


The consequences of a successful XSS attack can vary, ranging from defacing websites, stealing sensitive information (such as login credentials or personal data), session hijacking, or even spreading malware to unsuspecting users.

Preventing XSS vulnerabilities involves input validation and sanitization of user-supplied data, properly encoding output to prevent script execution, and implementing security mechanisms like Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the execution of external scripts. Regular security updates and patches should also be applied to the web application to address any known vulnerabilities.

### Injection Attacks

Injection attacks are a type of security vulnerability where an attacker is able to inject malicious code or commands into a vulnerable system, typically by exploiting input validation or sanitization flaws. The injected code or commands can manipulate the behavior of the system and potentially gain unauthorized access, modify or retrieve sensitive data, or perform unintended actions.

#### Structured Query Language (SQL)

Is a programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It allows users to interact with databases by performing operations such as querying data, inserting, updating, and deleting records. SQL injection is a common type of injection attack where an attacker inserts malicious SQL code into a vulnerable application's input fields, tricking the application into executing unintended SQL commands.

SQL Injection Example:

Let's say we have a website with a login form that accepts a username and password. The website's code uses user-supplied input directly in an SQL query without proper validation or sanitization. The SQL query might look like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '<user-input>' AND password = '<user-input>';
```

Now, imagine a malicious user enters the following in the username field:

```
' OR '1'='1
```

The resulting SQL query after the injection would become:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = '<user-input>';
```

The injected code `' OR '1'='1` is a Boolean expression that always evaluates to true. By doing this, the attacker bypasses the password check and gains unauthorized access to the system. The query will return all rows from the "users" table, effectively allowing the attacker to log in as any user in the system.

This is a basic example, but SQL injection attacks can become more sophisticated and have severe consequences, such as extracting sensitive information, modifying databases, or executing arbitrary commands on the database server. That's why it's crucial to implement proper input validation, parameterized queries, or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

#### Dynamic-Link Library (DLL)

Is a file containing code and data that can be used by multiple programs simultaneously. DLLs are used in Microsoft Windows operating systems to provide shared functions and resources to different applications. However, DLL injection is a technique used by attackers to inject malicious code into a running process by forcing it to load a malicious DLL file. This technique allows the attacker to gain control over the process and potentially execute unauthorized actions.

DLL Injection Example:

Let's consider a scenario where a legitimate application, called "TargetApp.exe," loads a DLL file to provide additional functionality. The application loads the DLL using a function call, such as `LoadLibrary` or `GetProcAddress`.

An attacker with malicious intent identifies a vulnerability in the TargetApp.exe that allows them to inject their own code into the process. They create a malicious DLL file, called "MaliciousDLL.dll," that contains their code.

The attacker takes advantage of the vulnerability to inject the MaliciousDLL.dll into the running process of TargetApp.exe. The injected DLL gains access to the address space of the process and can execute its code within that context.

Once the MaliciousDLL.dll is successfully injected, it can perform various malicious actions, such as:

1. Keylogging: The DLL can intercept and record keystrokes made by the user within the TargetApp.exe.
2. Credential Theft: The DLL can capture sensitive information, such as login credentials, entered by the user within the TargetApp.exe.
3. System Control: The DLL can modify or manipulate system settings, access files, or execute arbitrary commands within the context of the TargetApp.exe process.
4. Data Theft: The DLL can access and exfiltrate sensitive data from the TargetApp.exe process.


#### Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)

Is a widely used protocol for accessing and managing directory information services. Directory information services store and organize data, such as user accounts, organizational structures, and other relevant information. They act as a central repository for managing and retrieving data in a hierarchical format.

Similar to SQL, LDAP provides a standardized approach for querying and modifying data. While SQL is primarily used for relational databases, LDAP is specifically designed for directory services. Both protocols allow users to perform operations such as searching for specific data, adding new entries, modifying existing entries, and deleting entries.

However, just like SQL injection, LDAP injection is a type of attack where an adversary exploits vulnerabilities in the application's handling of user-supplied input. In the case of LDAP injection, the attacker manipulates LDAP queries by inserting malicious input, potentially leading to unauthorized access or disclosure of sensitive information.

LDAP Injection Example:
Assume that username is user and password is pwd in an authentication request. Corresponding LDAP query could be ```(&(Username=user)(Password=pwd))```

An attacker could inject an LDAP query into username field to gain access to the application without providing correct password.

One possible LDAP injection is ```)(&)``` to user name parameter value. The LDAP query with injection will be ```(&(Username=user<b>)(&)</b>)(Password=pwd))```

How does this small injection help in authentication bypass?

* In case of queries like <b>(&(Username=user)(&))(Password=pwd))</b> ; only the first filter i.e, ```(&(Username=user)(&))``` is processed by LDAP server.
* ```(&)``` is absolute true assertion in LDAP. Thus, making the filter ```(&(Username=user)(&))``` always true. An attacker can now access the application without providing correct password.

#### Extensible Markup Language (XML)

Is a markup language that defines rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. It is widely used for representing structured data and exchanging information between different systems. XML injection, also known as XXE (XML External Entity) injection, is an attack where an attacker injects malicious XML code into an application that parses XML input. This can lead to various security vulnerabilities, including unauthorized data disclosure and denial of service attacks.

XML Injection Example:

Suppose you have a web application that accepts XML input (commonly seen in various types of applications, especially those that involve data exchange, configuration, or messaging) from users and processes it. The application parses the XML and performs certain actions based on its content.

Let's say the application expects XML input in the following format:

```xml
<user>
  <name>John Doe</name>
  <email>john@example.com</email>
</user>
```

The application processes the XML and extracts the user's name and email to perform some operations.

Now, imagine a malicious user submits the following XML input:

```xml
<user>
  <name>John Doe</name>
  <email>john@example.com</email>
  <admin>true</admin>
</user>
```

In this example, the attacker injected an additional `<admin>true</admin>` element within the XML input.

If the application doesn't properly validate or sanitize the XML input, it may blindly trust and act upon the injected `<admin>` element. This could lead to unintended consequences, such as granting administrative privileges to the user or executing unauthorized actions.


### Pointer/Object Dereference

A pointer is a construct that refers to the memory location where a variable is stored, rather than directly holding the value itself. To access the value stored at the memory location pointed to by a pointer, you need to perform a process called dereferencing.

Dereferencing a pointer changes the interpretation of the pointer. Instead of representing the memory location, dereferencing retrieves the actual contents of that memory location. It allows you to work with the value itself, rather than just the memory address.

Pointers can be powerful because they enable efficient operations on a variety of data structures. However, they can also be risky if used incorrectly, as mistakes can lead to unexpected issues. For example, when a programmer combines user input with pointers, it allows the user to select a specific location in an array and use a pointer to reference the value stored there. If there are errors in validating the user input, it can result in mistakes during the pointer dereference process.

Mistakes in pointer dereferencing may or may not trigger an error. The memory location being accessed will contain data, so it will be returned, even if it's not the intended or valid value. This connection between pointers and the objects they reference is referred to as pointer/object dereference.


### Directory Traversal

In a directory traversal attack, an attacker manipulates input to bypass the directory structure of a filesystem. By including special encoded symbols like "../.." in an unchecked input field, the attacker tricks the parser into interpreting the encoding as traversal code. This allows them to navigate to different locations in the filesystem than intended, potentially executing commands in an unauthorized manner. When combined with a command injection vulnerability, this attack can lead to the execution of unauthorized code.

Directory traversal attacks are categorized as input validation errors and can be challenging to detect without thorough code reviews and specific scrutiny. This highlights the importance of using resources like the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Errors checklist during code reviews. Such checklists help alert developers to potential issues like directory traversal during the development process.

To make detection more difficult, attackers can mask directory traversals by using input encoding. If the security check is performed before the string is decoded by the system parser, it becomes harder to recognize the attack. There are multiple ways to represent a particular input form, with the canonical form being the simplest example. Parsers are responsible for rendering the canonical form for the operating system, but these embedded parsers may act after input validation, making it challenging to detect certain attacks by simply matching a string.

### Buffer Overflow

Is a type of software vulnerability that occurs when a program tries to write more data into a buffer (a temporary storage area in memory) than it can handle. This can happen when the size of the input data exceeds the capacity of the buffer.

When a buffer overflow occurs, the extra data spills over into adjacent memory locations, overwriting important information such as return addresses, function pointers, or other variables. This can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities.

Attackers can exploit buffer overflow vulnerabilities to execute malicious code or gain unauthorized access to a system. By carefully crafting input data, an attacker can overwrite critical memory structures and take control of the program's execution.

Here's a simplified example to illustrate a buffer overflow vulnerability:

```c
void copyData(char* source) {
    char buffer[8];
    strcpy(buffer, source);
    // ...
}

int main() {
    char input[16];
    // Assume the user provides input larger than 8 characters
    scanf("%s", input);
    copyData(input);
    // ...
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `copyData` function receives a source string and tries to copy it into a buffer with a size of 8 characters. However, if the user provides input larger than 8 characters, it will overflow the buffer.

If an attacker supplies input with a length greater than 8 characters, the extra data will overwrite adjacent memory locations beyond the buffer's boundaries. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, including crashing the program or executing malicious instructions.

It's worth noting that modern programming languages and frameworks often include built-in safeguards against buffer overflows, making it less common in well-designed and secure software. However, developers should still be aware of the potential risks and take appropriate precautions when handling user input and managing memory.

### Race Condition

Is a software vulnerability that occurs when the behavior or outcome of a program depends on the sequence or timing of events. It arises when multiple processes or threads access shared resources or perform operations concurrently without proper synchronization or coordination.

In a race condition, the exact order or timing of these concurrent operations becomes unpredictable, leading to unexpected and potentially undesirable results. The outcome of the program becomes dependent on which process or thread "wins the race" to access or modify the shared resource.

Here's a simplified example to illustrate a race condition:

```c
int balance = 100; // Shared variable

void withdraw(int amount) {
    if (balance >= amount) {
        // Simulate some delay
        sleep(1);
        balance -= amount;
        printf("Withdrawal successful. New balance: %d\n", balance);
    } else {
        printf("Insufficient balance\n");
    }
}

// Assume two threads call the withdraw function simultaneously
```

In this example, two threads call the `withdraw` function concurrently, trying to withdraw amounts from a shared `balance` variable. If the balance is sufficient, the thread checks the balance, delays for a second (to simulate some processing), and then deducts the amount from the balance. Otherwise, it prints an "Insufficient balance" message.

However, a race condition can occur if both threads access the shared `balance` variable simultaneously. The following sequence of events can lead to an unexpected outcome:

1. Thread A and Thread B both check the balance and find it to be sufficient.
2. Thread A delays for a second (as per the sleep statement) before deducting the amount.
3. During the delay, Thread B also deducts the amount from the balance.
4. Thread A deducts the amount from the balance, unaware that Thread B has already done the same.
5. The final balance is lower than expected, resulting in a potential inconsistency or incorrect behavior.

Race conditions can cause various issues, including data corruption, incorrect results, crashes, or security vulnerabilities. They can be particularly challenging to identify and reproduce because they depend on the timing and interleaving of concurrent operations.

To prevent race conditions, proper synchronization mechanisms such as locks, semaphores, or atomic operations should be employed to ensure exclusive access to shared resources. By synchronizing the access to critical sections of code or shared data, developers can mitigate race conditions and maintain the correctness and integrity of the program.

#### Time of Check/Time of Use (TOCTOU)

Time of Check/Time of Use (TOCTOU) is a security vulnerability that occurs when there is a gap between checking a condition and using a resource based on that condition. 

Imagine you have a program that checks if a user has permission to access a file before reading its contents. Here's a simplified breakdown:

1. Checking Permissions: The program verifies if the user has the required permissions to access the file. It does this by comparing the user's privileges against the file's permission settings.

2. Time Gap: Between the permission check and the actual file usage, there is a gap of time during which other operations can occur. During this gap, the security context may change, which can affect the permissions of the file.

3. Manipulation: An attacker, aware of this gap, can attempt to manipulate the conditions or resources during this time. They exploit weaknesses or vulnerabilities in the system to gain unauthorized access.

4. Unauthorized Usage: If the attacker successfully manipulates the conditions, they can bypass the permission checks and gain access to the file. This allows them to perform actions they wouldn't have been allowed to do otherwise.

To mitigate TOCTOU vulnerabilities, it's important to reduce the time gap between condition checks and resource usage, use secure coding practices, and validate permissions at the time of resource usage. Regular monitoring and auditing of permissions also help detect any unauthorized changes. By addressing these concerns, we can minimize the risk of unauthorized access and maintain the security of our systems.
