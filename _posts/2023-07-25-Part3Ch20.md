# Chapter 20: Wireless Security


## Cryptographic Protocols

### Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2)
WPA2 is a security protocol commonly used to protect Wi-Fi networks. It employs the AES-CCMP encryption algorithm to provide data confidentiality and integrity. WPA2 replaced the less secure WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) and WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) protocols. By using stronger encryption and more secure authentication mechanisms, WPA2 significantly enhances the security of wireless communications. However, vulnerabilities like the KRACK attack have exposed potential weaknesses in certain implementations of WPA2.

### Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3)
WPA3 is the next generation of Wi-Fi security protocols, addressing some of the limitations of WPA2. It introduces enhanced security mechanisms, such as Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) for stronger key exchange, and individualized data encryption for open Wi-Fi networks. WPA3 aims to protect against common attacks like brute-force password guessing and increases the security of Wi-Fi networks, making them more resilient to evolving threats.

### Counter Mode/CBC-MAC Protocol (CCMP)
CCMP is an encryption protocol used in WPA2 to secure data transmitted over Wi-Fi networks. It combines two cryptographic techniques: Counter Mode (CCM) for encryption and Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code (CBC-MAC) for message integrity. CCMP ensures that data is both encrypted and authenticated, preventing unauthorized access and tampering.

### Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)
SAE is a key exchange protocol introduced in WPA3. It enhances the security of the initial handshake between a device and an access point, making it resistant to offline dictionary attacks on weak passwords. SAE is designed to provide strong security while allowing devices to authenticate each other without revealing their passwords, thus reducing the risk of password-related vulnerabilities.

## Authentication Protocols

### Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
EAP is a framework that allows various authentication methods to be used in network communication. EAP provides flexibility by enabling different authentication mechanisms to be employed, such as token cards, digital certificates, or biometrics. It enables secure authentication across various network types, including wireless, wired, and remote access networks.

### Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP)
PEAP is an EAP method that adds an additional layer of security to the authentication process. It creates a secure TLS tunnel between the client and the authentication server, protecting user credentials during the authentication process. PEAP is commonly used in enterprise environments to enhance the security of wireless and remote access connections.

### EAP-FAST
EAP-FAST (Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling) is an EAP method designed for faster authentication while maintaining security. It combines elements of EAP-TLS and EAP-TTLS, using protected passwords and dynamic WEP keys to establish a secure connection. EAP-FAST is particularly useful in scenarios where complex user authentication is required.

### EAP-TLS
EAP-TLS (EAP-Transport Layer Security) uses digital certificates to authenticate both the client and the server. This method ensures mutual authentication, where both parties verify each other's identity using their certificates. EAP-TLS provides strong security by leveraging the security of digital certificates and the TLS protocol.

### EAP-TTLS
EAP-TTLS (EAP-Tunneled Transport Layer Security) is an EAP method that establishes a secure tunnel for user authentication. It allows various authentication mechanisms within the tunnel, providing flexibility while still maintaining security. EAP-TTLS is beneficial in situations where the client's identity must be protected.

### IEEE 802.1X
IEEE 802.1X is a standard for port-based network access control. It enhances network security by ensuring that only authorized devices can connect to network ports, such as those on Ethernet switches or wireless access points. 802.1X is commonly used to prevent unauthorized access in both wired and wireless networks.

### Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS)
RADIUS is a networking protocol that provides centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) services. It is widely used for managing user access to networks, such as dial-up and Wi-Fi networks. RADIUS allows organizations to enforce security policies and manage user access from a central location.

### Federation
Federation enables single sign-on (SSO) across multiple organizations or domains. It allows users to access resources using their credentials from their home organization, eliminating the need for separate accounts and logins. Federation enhances user convenience and simplifies access management across different systems.
