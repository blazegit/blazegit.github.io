# 5.1 Security Controls

# Security Controls

Security controls are measures and safeguards implemented to protect systems, data, and assets from security risks and threats. They help organizations manage risk and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their information.

## Categories

### Managerial Controls
Managerial controls are policies, procedures, and guidelines that define the overall security strategy, responsibilities, and objectives of an organization. They include security policies, risk assessments, security awareness training, and security governance.

### Operational Controls
Operational controls are practices and processes that ensure security policies are effectively implemented and followed. They involve activities like access management, security monitoring, incident response, and change management.

### Technical Controls
Technical controls are technologies and mechanisms used to enforce security policies and protect systems. They include firewalls, encryption, access control mechanisms, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus software.

## Control Types

### Preventative Controls
Preventative controls aim to stop security incidents from occurring. They include measures like access restrictions, authentication mechanisms, encryption, and security training to reduce the likelihood of threats.

### Detective Controls
Detective controls are designed to identify security incidents that have occurred. They involve activities like log monitoring, intrusion detection systems, and security audits to detect and alert on potential breaches.

### Corrective Controls
Corrective controls are measures taken in response to identified security incidents. They involve actions like patching vulnerabilities, disabling compromised accounts, and recovering from data breaches to mitigate the impact of incidents.

### Deterrent Controls
Deterrent controls discourage potential attackers by making the target less appealing or more challenging to breach. Examples include security cameras, warning signs, and visible security measures.

### Compensating Controls
Compensating controls provide an alternative safeguard when primary controls cannot be implemented. They help address security gaps or limitations and ensure adequate protection.

### Physical Controls
Physical controls involve securing physical assets and facilities to prevent unauthorized access. Examples include locks, access cards, biometric authentication, and surveillance systems.
