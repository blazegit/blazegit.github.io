# 3.8 Implement Authentication and Authorization


## Authentication Management

### Password Keys

Password keys involve using passwords as a form of authentication. While widely used, passwords can be susceptible to breaches if not managed securely. Password policies and practices, such as enforcing complexity requirements and regular updates, are important for maintaining security.

### Password Vaults

Password vaults are secure repositories for storing and managing passwords. They provide a central location to securely store and retrieve passwords, reducing the risk of password-related vulnerabilities.

### TPM (Trusted Platform Module)

A TPM is a hardware component that provides cryptographic functions and secure storage for encryption keys, passwords, and certificates. It enhances security by protecting sensitive information and ensuring secure boot processes.

### HSM (Hardware Security Module)

An HSM is a dedicated hardware device that generates, stores, and manages cryptographic keys. It provides a high level of security for key management and cryptographic operations.

### Knowledge-based Authentication

Knowledge-based authentication involves using information known only to the user as an authentication factor. This can include personal questions, PINs, or other knowledge-based challenges. However, this method can be vulnerable to social engineering attacks.

## Authentication

### EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)

EAP is a framework for various authentication methods used in wireless networks and point-to-point connections. It provides flexibility to choose authentication mechanisms while ensuring security.

### Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)

CHAP is a protocol used for authentication in point-to-point connections, such as dial-up or VPN connections. It involves a challenge-response mechanism to verify the identity of the connecting device.

### Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)

PAP is a simple authentication protocol that transmits passwords in clear text, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping. It's considered insecure and is generally avoided in favor of more secure methods.

### 802.1X

802.1X is a network access control standard used to authenticate devices before granting them access to a network. It is commonly used in Wi-Fi networks to ensure that only authorized devices can connect.

### RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service)

RADIUS is a protocol used for centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting for remote access servers. It enables organizations to manage user authentication from a single point.

### Single Sign-On (SSO)

SSO allows users to access multiple applications or services with a single set of credentials. Once authenticated, users can access various resources without needing to log in again.

### Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)

SAML is an XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, typically between an identity provider and a service provider. It enables single sign-on across different domains.

### Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus (TACACS+)

TACACS+ is a protocol used for centralized authentication and authorization in network devices. It provides a framework for managing access control and user privileges.

### OAuth

OAuth is an authorization framework used for allowing third-party applications to access a user's resources without exposing their credentials. It is commonly used for granting access to APIs and services.

### OpenID

OpenID is an open standard for single sign-on and identity authentication. It allows users to log in to multiple websites using a single set of credentials.

### Kerberos

Kerberos is a network authentication protocol that uses tickets to verify the identity of users and services. It provides secure authentication in distributed environments.

## Access Control Schemes

### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

ABAC determines access based on attributes associated with users, resources, and the environment. It offers fine-grained control and dynamic access decisions based on a combination of attributes.

### Role-Based Access Control

Role-Based Access Control assigns access rights based on predefined roles. Users are assigned roles, and access is granted based on the associated permissions.

### Rule-Based Access Control

Rule-Based Access Control enforces access based on a set of rules defined by the system administrator. It allows for more complex access decisions based on specific conditions.

### MAC (Mandatory Access Control)

MAC enforces access based on security labels or classifications assigned to subjects and objects. It is commonly used in highly secure environments to ensure strict data protection.

### Discretionary Access Control (DAC)

DAC grants control to the owner of a resource, allowing them to determine who can access the resource and what level of access they have.

### Conditional Access

Conditional access policies determine access based on specific conditions or criteria, such as device health or user location. It allows organizations to adapt access controls based on dynamic factors.

### Privileged Access Management

Privileged Access Management involves controlling and monitoring access to privileged accounts and systems. It ensures that users with elevated privileges follow strict security protocols.

### File System Permissions

File system permissions define who can access and modify files and directories. They include read, write, and execute permissions for different user groups, ensuring data security and privacy.
