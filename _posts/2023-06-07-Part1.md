# Part I Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities


## Chapter 1: Social Engineering Techniques


### What is social engineering

Social engineering is a form of manipulation that involves deceiving or tricking individuals to gain unauthorized access to information, systems, or resources. It exploits human psychology and trust to exploit vulnerabilities, rather than relying on technical means. The goal is to exploit human weaknesses to achieve their malicious objectives, such as stealing personal data, accessing secure systems, or carrying out fraudulent activities.

### Phishing

Phishing is a type of social engineering where attackers trick people into revealing sensitive information by pretending to be a trustworthy source, such as a well-known company. They often send emails or messages to a large group of people, asking them to visit a website that looks legitimate but is actually controlled by the attacker. The website then requests personal information like usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, or banking details. Sometimes, the message claims that the user's account has been compromised, and they need to enter their information for security purposes. Another common phishing example is when recipients receive an email from a bank, claiming a security breach and asking them to click a link to verify their account. Clicking the link takes them to a fake bank website where their account and password are captured by the attacker. Phishing is the most common type of social engineering attack, targeting both computer system access and personal financial information.

To notice a phishing attack and prevent falling victim to it, here are some key steps and indicators to keep in mind:

1. Be cautious of unsolicited emails or messages: If you receive an unexpected email or message, especially from unfamiliar senders or organizations, exercise caution.
2. Verify the source: Check the email address, domain, or sender's identity to ensure it matches the official contact information of the organization they claim to represent. Be wary of slight variations or misspellings in the email address.
3. Examine the message content: Phishing emails often contain spelling or grammar errors, urgent requests, or generic greetings instead of personalized information. Be skeptical of emails that create a sense of urgency, claim you've won a prize or lottery, or offer large sums of money.
4. Hover over links: Before clicking on any links in an email, hover your mouse cursor over them to see the actual URL. Ensure the link matches the claimed destination or appears legitimate.
5. Check for secure connections: When submitting personal information online, look for a padlock icon in the address bar and ensure the website's URL begins with "https://" (the "s" stands for secure).
6. Be cautious of pop-ups: Phishing attempts can use deceptive pop-up windows to collect your information. Avoid entering personal data or login credentials into pop-ups unless you initiated the interaction.

### Smishing

Is a form of attack that targets mobile phones using Short Message Service (SMS). It is essentially a type of phishing through SMS. The attack involves sending an SMS message to the victim, directing them to click on a URL. This URL can lead to various attack methods, including the distribution of malware. The success of this attack relies on creating a sense of urgency and intimidation in the message. For example, the message might warn the user about an unwanted subscription and instruct them to click the link to unsubscribe before being billed. Clicking the URL initiates the next stage of the attack.

### Vishing

Vishing is a variation of phishing that exploits voice communication technology to gather targeted information. Attackers take advantage of people's trust in the telephone network by simulating calls from legitimate entities using Voice over IP (VoIP) or compromising voice messaging systems. 

Users may receive emails instructing them to call a number answered by a potentially compromised voice message system, or they may receive recorded messages that appear to be from reputable sources. 

To protect themselves, users should not provide sensitive information in response to such messages. Instead, they should independently find a legitimate phone number through the internet or account statements to contact the entity, verify the message's legitimacy, and report the vishing attempt. Vishing attacks combine technical elements with psychological pressure to manipulate users into divulging their information.

### Spam

Spam refers to the bulk sending of unsolicited emails. While it may not be commonly seen as a social engineering or security issue, it can still pose security concerns. Spam emails can be both legitimate, sent by companies advertising products or services, or malicious, containing attachments with harmful software or links to malicious websites that aim to collect personal information. Since spam is unsolicited, it is crucial to exercise caution and consider the source before clicking on any links or responding directly. It should be recognized as a form of social engineering as it aims to alter human behavior and trick users into taking actions that may compromise their security.

### Spam over Instant Messaging (SPIM)

SPIM, an acronym for "Spam over Instant Messaging," is a lesser-known variation of spam that involves the delivery of unsolicited messages through instant messaging applications. The objective of hostile SPIM remains the same as traditional spam: to deceive unsuspecting users into clicking on malicious content or links, thereby initiating an attack. Just like spam emails, hostile SPIM aims to exploit users' trust and curiosity to lure them into engaging with harmful elements that could compromise their security.

### Spear Phishing

Spear phishing is a term used to describe a targeted phishing attack that <u>focuses on a specific individual or a group of people</u> who share a common characteristic. Unlike general phishing attempts, spear phishing is tailored to the recipients, such as senior executives or employees of a specific organization. This targeted approach increases the likelihood of success because the attack appears more credible and relevant to the recipients, making them more likely to respond. By personalizing the attack, spear phishing creates a higher ratio of successful responses compared to random or widespread phishing campaigns.

### Dumpster Diving

Dumpster diving is a term used in the security community to describe the process of searching through someone's trash in the hopes of finding valuable information that can be used in a penetration attempt. Attackers, including identity thieves, private investigators, or even law enforcement personnel, have historically used this tactic to gather information about individuals or organizations.

By rummaging through discarded materials, attackers may discover small but useful pieces of information that can aid in an attack, including user IDs and passwords if the target's security procedures are weak. Trash, in most cases, is not considered private property once it has been discarded, and even though dumpster diving may be illegal in some places, enforcement is often minimal.

To mitigate the risks associated with dumpster diving, organizations should have policies in place for discarding materials. Sensitive information should be shredded, and measures like securing the trash receptacle can prevent unauthorized access. Individuals should also consider shredding personal or sensitive information before disposing of it in their own trash. Investing in a reasonably priced shredder is a worthwhile precaution to prevent potential losses resulting from identity theft.

### Shoulder Surfing

Shoulder surfing is a method of obtaining sensitive information by directly observing an individual as they enter the information on a form, keypad, or keyboard. The attacker may observe the target's actions by looking over their shoulder or use tools like cameras or binoculars to view the input. The goal is to gather valuable data like a personal identification number (PIN) at an ATM, an access control entry code, or credit card details.

To counter shoulder surfing attacks, various measures have been implemented. Privacy screens or filters are now used in many locations to enclose keypads, making it difficult for observers to see the entered information. Some advanced systems even scramble the number layout on keypads, changing the positions of the numbers dynamically. This prevents attackers from memorizing the button pattern since the number locations constantly change. Although this may slightly slow down the user's input, it effectively thwarts the attacker's attempts to mimic the button presses

### Pharming

Pharming is a technique used by attackers to redirect users to fake websites that mimic official ones. Unlike phishing, which involves targeting individuals with emails, pharming operates by manipulating the user's access to websites without requiring them to take any action.

In pharming attacks, users are directed to fake websites through methods such as DNS poisoning, where the URLs in a server's domain name table are maliciously altered, or by modifying local host files that convert URLs to their corresponding IP addresses. These tactics deceive the user into believing they have accessed the legitimate website when, in reality, they are interacting with a fraudulent one.

Once on the fake website, users may unknowingly provide personal information, assuming they are connected to the genuine site. This can lead to significant risks, as the attackers can capture and misuse the supplied sensitive data.

### Tailgating

Tailgating, also known as piggybacking, is a tactic where an attacker closely follows behind a person who has used their access card or PIN to gain physical access to a room or building. Exploiting people's tendency to overlook security practices when in a hurry, attackers take advantage of the authorized user's actions to gain entry without needing an access code or card.

Similar to shoulder surfing, tailgating relies on the attacker capitalizing on an authorized user's failure to follow security procedures. The attacker may even engage the target in conversation before reaching the door, creating a sense of familiarity and comfort that allows them to enter without being challenged. As such, piggybacking falls under social engineering attacks.

Both piggybacking and shoulder surfing exploit the weak security practices of authorized users. Organizations can counter these techniques by training employees to follow simple procedures to ensure that no one follows them closely or observes their actions. A more advanced countermeasure against piggybacking is the use of a mantrap, which employs two closely spaced doors. The second door remains closed until the first one is closed, creating an enclosure that permits only one person to pass at a time.

By promoting awareness and implementing physical security measures like mantraps, organizations can mitigate the risks associated with tailgating and enhance overall security.

### Eliciting Information

The goal of eliciting information is to gather sensitive or valuable data that can be used for further attacks, such as unauthorized access to systems, identity theft, or other forms of exploitation.

Social engineers can exploit calls to or from help desk and tech support units as a means of eliciting valuable information. These skilled manipulators utilize various psychological techniques to persuade individuals, whose primary role is to assist others, into performing actions that compromise security. For instance, an attacker can masquerade as an employee to trick help desk or tech support personnel into resetting passwords, divulging system information, or providing other sensitive details.

Conversely, the social engineer can also impersonate a help desk or tech support representative and contact employees directly. Through these deceptive calls, the attacker gathers information about system status and other intriguing elements for future exploitation.

These tactics capitalize on the trust placed in support personnel and their willingness to assist. To mitigate this risk, organizations should prioritize comprehensive training programs to educate help desk and tech support staff on identifying and verifying the identities of individuals making information requests or seeking system access. Implementing stringent authentication and verification protocols during such interactions significantly reduces the likelihood of falling prey to social engineering attacks through help desk or tech support channels.

### Whaling

While both whaling and spear phishing involve targeted attacks, they are not the same. The key difference lies in their specific targets and scope.

Spear phishing focuses on a particular group of people who share a common characteristic, such as senior executives within an organization. The attacker tailors the phishing emails or messages to appear relevant to that group, increasing the chances of success. The goal is to trick individuals within the targeted group into divulging sensitive information or performing specific actions.

On the other hand, whaling specifically targets high-profile individuals, typically senior executives or individuals in influential positions. Whaling attacks aim to deceive and exploit these high-value targets due to their authority, access to sensitive information, or financial power. The attackers invest time and effort in customizing the attack to maximize its effectiveness against these specific individuals. Whaling attacks often employ sophisticated techniques and may involve more personalization than traditional spear phishing attempts.

In summary, spear phishing is a broader term encompassing targeted attacks towards specific groups, while whaling refers to highly targeted attacks directed at high-profile individuals with significant influence or access to valuable resources. Whaling attacks are often seen as a subset of spear phishing, focusing on a specific caliber of targets.

### Prepending

Prepending in social engineering means adding information to a request before asking for something. This extra information is used to make the request seem more legitimate and important. The attacker may claim to be sent by the target's boss or someone in authority to make their request seem valid. By doing this, the attacker hopes to convince the target to perform a specific action that they wouldn't normally do. Prepending relies on the psychological concept of authority to make the target more likely to comply with the subsequent request.

In summary, prepending is a social engineering technique where the attacker adds information or context to a request, leveraging authority constructs to make the target more likely to comply with subsequent actions that they would otherwise question.

### Identity Fraud

Identity fraud involves using fake credentials or impersonation to achieve a specific goal. The level of risk can vary, ranging from posing as a government official or regulator to pretending to be a maintenance worker. For example, an attacker might pose as a delivery person or a technician bringing a server and attempt to gain direct access to a server room. This type of fraud is particularly effective when the victim is expecting the imposter, such as during a server repair under warranty. Identity fraud can also occur online by using known information about the person being impersonated and deceiving the targeted victim.

Defending against identity fraud follows similar principles to other social engineering attacks. Strong policies and procedures should be in place without any exceptions. For instance, all packages should be delivered to a security desk, and visitors requiring access should be escorted without exceptions. Similarly, disclosure policies, such as password resets or granting access, should have no exceptions. Adhering strictly to these rules is essential in preventing most social engineering attacks. Comparing it to the security measures implemented by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) at airports, while the effectiveness of their screening methods may be debated, it is nearly impossible to bypass their security lines. This highlights the importance of following established protocols to mitigate social engineering attacks.

### Invoice Scams

Invoice scams involve sending a fake invoice to a company with the aim of tricking them into paying for goods or services they did not order. The scam works by targeting individuals outside of the accounting department to initiate the payment process, making it appear more legitimate. Despite the apparent simplicity of the scam and companies having strong accounting controls, cybercriminals are able to collect billions of dollars using this method. Common items used in these scams include office supplies, cleaning products, memberships, and various corporate services. To create a sense of urgency, scammers may include a final notice threatening to report the organization to a collection agency, causing recipients to hesitate before disregarding the bill.

### Credential Harvesting

Credential harvesting involves gathering sensitive credential information, such as usernames and passwords, with the aim of gaining unauthorized access to a system or account. One common method of credential harvesting is through phishing emails. The attacker sends an email that tricks the recipient into clicking a link, which leads them to a fake replica of a legitimate website, such as a bank's login page. Unaware of the deception, users enter their credentials on the fake page, unknowingly providing the attacker with their login information.

The main objective of credential harvesting is to acquire the user's credentials. Once the attacker obtains the credentials, they may redirect the user to the genuine website or display an error message, creating the illusion that the login attempt was unsuccessful. This is done to conceal the fact that the credentials have been stolen. Credential harvesting has been a highly successful attack method, prompting financial institutions and other organizations to implement additional security measures.

To mitigate the risk of harvested credentials being misused, many organizations have adopted two-factor authentication (2FA). In 2FA, users are required to provide a second form of identification, in addition to their credentials, to verify their identity. This second factor is typically unique and time-limited, adding an extra layer of security. For example, when logging into a bank's website, the user might receive a text message with a one-time code that they need to enter to complete the login process. By implementing 2FA, organizations significantly complicate the attacker's ability to misuse harvested credentials.

### Hoax

A hoax in cybersecurity refers to a deceptive or fraudulent attempt to trick individuals into believing something that is not true or to manipulate them into taking actions that can compromise their security or privacy. In the context of the provided sentence, hoaxes often take the form of misleading emails, Facebook posts, tweets, or other online messages that appear genuine but are actually designed to deceive recipients.

For instance, an email might falsely claim that you have won a substantial amount of money, enticing you to provide personal information or make a payment to claim the supposed prize. Similarly, a fake Facebook page or tweet might pose as a legitimate source, such as a well-known company or organization, and falsely notify you that your system needs an urgent update. The intention behind such hoaxes is typically to exploit unsuspecting individuals and gain unauthorized access to their sensitive information, install malware on their devices, or carry out other malicious activities.

### Impersonation

Attackers pretend to be someone the target knows and trust, whether in person, over the phone, or online. By taking on a familiar role, the attacker exploits the target's biases and persuades them to follow certain procedures. Impersonation can take various forms, such as impersonating third parties, help desk operators, vendors, or even online sources.

Let's say you receive a phone call from someone claiming to be a representative from your bank. They introduce themselves using the name of a legitimate employee and provide some personal details about you, such as your account number or recent transactions, to make their story more convincing. They explain that there has been suspicious activity on your account and ask you to verify your login credentials or provide sensitive information to resolve the issue.

In reality, the caller is an impersonator trying to trick you into revealing your account details. They may use tactics like urgency, authority, or fear to manipulate you into complying with their requests. By impersonating someone you trust, they exploit your trust and attempt to gain access to your personal or financial information.
