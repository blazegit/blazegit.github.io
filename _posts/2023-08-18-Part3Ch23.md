# 3.7 Identity and Account Management Controls

## Identity

### Identity Provider (IdP)

An Identity Provider (IdP) serves as a trusted source of identity information and authentication services. It manages user identities and credentials, allowing users to access multiple applications and services with a single set of credentials. IdPs use protocols like SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) and OpenID Connect to facilitate secure authentication and single sign-on (SSO) experiences across different platforms.

### Attributes

Attributes are pieces of information associated with an identity, providing context and details about a user. These attributes can include a user's name, email address, role, group memberships, and more. They play a crucial role in determining access privileges and authorization levels within an organization's systems and applications.

### Certificates

Certificates are digital documents that consist of a public key, identity information, and a digital signature from a trusted authority called a Certificate Authority (CA). They are used to establish trust between parties in secure communications. SSL/TLS certificates, for example, are used to encrypt data transmitted between a user's browser and a website, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.

### Tokens

Tokens are small pieces of data generated during the authentication process. They are used to represent a user's identity and granted access rights. OAuth and OpenID Connect, commonly used for authentication and authorization, rely on tokens. Access tokens grant permission to access resources, while ID tokens provide information about the authenticated user.

### SSH Keys

SSH keys are cryptographic key pairs used for secure communication and remote access to systems via the SSH protocol. A user has a private key stored on their device and a corresponding public key stored on the server. When the user attempts to authenticate, the server verifies their identity using the public key. SSH keys offer a more secure alternative to password-based authentication.

### Smart Cards

Smart cards are physical devices that store identity credentials and cryptographic keys. They often have a microprocessor chip that securely stores and processes data. Smart cards are commonly used in two-factor authentication (2FA) scenarios, where users insert the card into a reader and provide a PIN to gain access.

## Account Types

### User Account

A user account represents an individual user within a system. It is associated with a unique identity, such as a username or email address, and is used for authentication and authorization. User accounts are assigned roles and permissions that determine their level of access to resources and data.

### Shared and Generic Accounts/Credentials

Shared accounts are used by multiple users to access a single account or system. While convenient, they pose security risks as it's challenging to attribute actions to specific individuals. Generic accounts, like "admin" or "guest," are shared for specific purposes. These accounts should have limited permissions and be carefully managed to prevent unauthorized access.

### Guest Accounts

Guest accounts provide temporary access to individuals who are not permanent members of an organization. They are often used for visitors, contractors, or temporary workers. Guest accounts have restricted permissions to limit their access to sensitive resources.

### Service Accounts

Service accounts are used by applications, services, or automated processes to access resources and perform tasks. They are often used to run background tasks, interact with APIs, or connect systems. Service accounts should be assigned the least privileges necessary to perform their intended functions.

## Account Policies

### Password Complexity

Password complexity policies require users to create strong passwords that include a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This reduces the likelihood of passwords being easily guessed or cracked by attackers.

### Password History

Password history policies prevent users from reusing previous passwords. This policy encourages users to create new passwords each time they update their credentials, enhancing security by minimizing the risk of password reuse.

### Password Reuse

Password reuse policies prevent users from using the same password within a specified period. This helps prevent users from quickly reverting to old passwords, ensuring greater security.


### Network Location

Network location policies control access based on the user's network location. Access might be allowed only from specific IP addresses or network ranges, adding an extra layer of security by limiting access to approved locations.

### Geofencing

Geofencing policies use geographic boundaries to control access. Users may be allowed to access resources only within defined geographic regions, enhancing security by restricting access to authorized locations.

### Geotagging

Geotagging involves attaching geographic metadata to data or devices. It helps track the location of data, users, or devices, providing context for auditing and security purposes.

### Geolocation

Geolocation policies use real-time location data to make access decisions. This can be particularly useful for mobile devices, allowing organizations to enforce access rules based on a user's physical location.

### Time-based Logins

Time-based login policies specify specific time windows during which users are allowed to authenticate and access resources. This is beneficial for enforcing access only during authorized working hours.

### Access Policies

Access policies define what resources a user or account can access and the actions they are permitted to perform. These policies ensure the principle of least privilege, granting users only the necessary access to perform their tasks.

### Account Permissions

Account permissions specify the level of access a user or account has within a system. This includes reading, writing, deleting, and modifying resources. Properly configuring permissions is crucial to maintaining security.

### Account Audits

Account audit policies monitor and log user activities to detect unusual or suspicious behavior. Auditing helps organizations identify potential security incidents, policy violations, or unauthorized access.

### Impossible Travel Time/Risky Login

Impossible travel time policies analyze login attempts to detect logins from different geographic locations within an implausibly short timeframe. This can indicate compromised accounts or unauthorized access.

### Lockout

Lockout policies automatically disable an account after a certain number of failed login attempts. This prevents brute-force attacks and unauthorized access attempts.

### Disablement

Account disablement policies ensure that accounts are properly disabled when users leave the organization or no longer require access. This prevents inactive accounts from being exploited and helps maintain security hygiene.
