# Chapter 3.4 Wireless Security


## Cryptographic Protocols

### Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2)

WPA2 is a security protocol commonly used to protect Wi-Fi networks. It employs the AES-CCMP encryption algorithm to provide data confidentiality and integrity. WPA2 replaced the less secure WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) and WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) protocols. By using stronger encryption and more secure authentication mechanisms, WPA2 significantly enhances the security of wireless communications. However, vulnerabilities like the KRACK (Key Reinstallation Attack) have exposed potential weaknesses in certain implementations of WPA2. The KRACK attack allows an adversary to intercept and manipulate Wi-Fi traffic, potentially leading to the decryption of sensitive information transmitted over the network.

### Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3)

WPA3 is the next generation of Wi-Fi security protocols, addressing some of the limitations of WPA2. It introduces enhanced security mechanisms, such as Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) for stronger key exchange, and individualized data encryption for open Wi-Fi networks. WPA3 aims to protect against common attacks like brute-force password guessing and increases the security of Wi-Fi networks, making them more resilient to evolving threats.

### Counter Mode/CBC-MAC Protocol (CCMP)

CCMP is an encryption protocol used in WPA2 to secure data transmitted over Wi-Fi networks. It combines two cryptographic techniques: Counter Mode (CCM) for encryption and Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code (CBC-MAC) for message integrity. CCMP ensures that data is both encrypted and authenticated, preventing unauthorized access and tampering.

### Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)

SAE is a key exchange protocol introduced in WPA3. It enhances the security of the initial handshake between a device and an access point, making it resistant to offline dictionary attacks on weak passwords. SAE is designed to provide strong security while allowing devices to authenticate each other without revealing their passwords, thus reducing the risk of password-related vulnerabilities.

## Authentication Protocols

### Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)

EAP is a framework that allows various authentication methods to be used in network communication. EAP provides flexibility by enabling different authentication mechanisms to be employed, such as token cards, digital certificates, or biometrics. It enables secure authentication across various network types, including wireless, wired, and remote access networks.

### Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP)

PEAP is an EAP method that adds an additional layer of security to the authentication process. It creates a secure TLS tunnel between the client and the authentication server, protecting user credentials during the authentication process. PEAP is commonly used in enterprise environments to enhance the security of wireless and remote access connections.

### EAP-FAST

EAP-FAST (Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling) is an EAP method designed for faster authentication while maintaining security. It combines elements of EAP-TLS and EAP-TTLS, using protected passwords and dynamic WEP keys to establish a secure connection. EAP-FAST is particularly useful in scenarios where complex user authentication is required.

### EAP-TLS

EAP-TLS (EAP-Transport Layer Security) uses digital certificates to authenticate both the client and the server. This method ensures mutual authentication, where both parties verify each other's identity using their certificates. EAP-TLS provides strong security by leveraging the security of digital certificates and the TLS protocol.

### EAP-TTLS

EAP-TTLS (EAP-Tunneled Transport Layer Security) is an EAP method that establishes a secure tunnel for user authentication. It allows various authentication mechanisms within the tunnel, providing flexibility while still maintaining security. EAP-TTLS is beneficial in situations where the client's identity must be protected.

### IEEE 802.1X

IEEE 802.1X is a standard for port-based network access control. It enhances network security by ensuring that only authorized devices can connect to network ports, such as those on Ethernet switches or wireless access points. 802.1X is commonly used to prevent unauthorized access in both wired and wireless networks.

### Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS)

RADIUS is a networking protocol that provides centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) services. It is widely used for managing user access to networks, such as dial-up and Wi-Fi networks. RADIUS allows organizations to enforce security policies and manage user access from a central location.

## Methods

### Pre-shared key (PSK) vs. Enterprise vs. Open

These are different authentication methods used in Wi-Fi networks. Pre-shared key (PSK) requires users to enter a password, while Enterprise uses more complex authentication methods, often involving a RADIUS server for authentication. Open networks do not require any authentication, allowing any device to connect without a password.

### WiFi Protected Setup (WPS)

WPS is a network security standard that simplifies the process of setting up a secure wireless network. It allows users to connect devices to a WPA- or WPA2-protected network without the need to enter the passphrase.

### Captive portals

Captive portals are web pages that control access to a public Wi-Fi network. Users are typically required to log in or agree to terms and conditions before accessing the internet. Captive portals are commonly used in public Wi-Fi hotspots, hotels, and cafes to control access and provide information.

## Installation considerations

### Site surveys

Site surveys are conducted to assess the feasibility of installing a wireless network in a specific location. They involve analyzing the area's physical layout, identifying potential obstacles or sources of interference, and determining optimal access point placement.

### Heat maps

Heat maps are visual representations of wireless signal strength in a particular area. They help identify areas with strong or weak Wi-Fi coverage, enabling network administrators to optimize the placement of access points for better overall coverage and performance.

### WiFi analyzers 

WiFi analyzers are tools used to monitor and analyze Wi-Fi networks, providing information about signal strength, channel congestion, and potential sources of interference. They help in optimizing network performance and identifying and resolving issues affecting wireless connectivity.

### Channel overlaps

Channel overlaps occur when multiple access points in close proximity use the same Wi-Fi channel, leading to interference and degraded network performance. Avoiding channel overlaps is essential for ensuring reliable and high-speed wireless connectivity.

### Wireless Access Point (WAP) placement

WAP placement is crucial for ensuring optimal Wi-Fi coverage and performance. Strategic placement of access points, considering factors such as signal strength, range, and interference, is essential for providing reliable and seamless wireless connectivity throughout the desired area.

### Controller and access point security 

Controller and access point security involves implementing measures to secure the management and control of Wi-Fi networks. This includes securing access points against unauthorized access, ensuring data encryption, and implementing security protocols to protect the network from potential threats and attacks.
