# 5.2 Regulations, Standards, and Frameworks


## Regulations, Standards, and Legislation

### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

GDPR is a European Union regulation that became enforceable in 2018. It is designed to protect the privacy and personal data of EU citizens. GDPR sets rules for how organizations collect, process, and store personal data and gives individuals greater control over their own information.

### National, Territory, or State Laws:

Countries, territories, or states often have their own laws and regulations concerning data protection, cybersecurity, and privacy. These laws may vary widely and can include requirements for data breach notifications, consumer privacy rights, and more.

### Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)

PCI DSS is a set of security standards established to ensure the secure handling of credit card information during online and offline transactions. Compliance with PCI DSS is crucial for businesses that handle payment card transactions to prevent data breaches and protect cardholder information.

## Key Frameworks

### Center for Internet Security (CIS)

CIS provides a set of best practices for securing IT systems and data. The CIS Controls offer a prioritized approach to cybersecurity, helping organizations implement effective security measures to address common threats.

### National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Risk Management Framework (RMF) / Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

NIST's RMF provides a structured process for managing and mitigating information security risks. The Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) offers a set of guidelines, standards, and best practices to help organizations manage and improve their cybersecurity posture.

### International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27001/27002/27701/31000

ISO 27001 specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an information security management system. ISO 27002 provides guidance on implementing the controls defined in ISO 27001. ISO 27701 extends these standards to address privacy management, and ISO 31000 focuses on risk management.

### SSAE SOC 2 Type I/II

Developed by the American Institute of CPAs, SOC 2 Type I focuses on the suitability of the design of controls at a specific point in time, while SOC 2 Type II assesses the operational effectiveness of these controls over a period.

### Cloud Security Alliance - Cloud Control Matrix - Reference Architecture

The Cloud Security Alliance provides guidelines for securing cloud computing environments. The Cloud Control Matrix (CCM) offers a framework to assess the security of cloud services, and reference architectures provide blueprints for secure cloud implementations.

## Benchmarks/Secure Configuration Guides

### Platform/Vendor-Specific Guides

These guides are specific to the technologies or platforms used by organizations. They offer detailed instructions on configuring settings and options to enhance security. For example, a web server guide might provide recommendations for securing Apache or Nginx.

#### Web Server

Web server security guides provide recommendations for securing the software and settings of web servers like Apache, Nginx, or Microsoft IIS to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and other cyber threats.

#### OS (Operating System)

Operating system security guides offer best practices for securing the underlying operating systems, such as Windows, Linux, or macOS, to protect against vulnerabilities and unauthorized access.

#### Application Server

These guides focus on securing application servers, such as those running Java EE or .NET applications, to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of hosted applications.

#### Network Infrastructure Devices

Security guides for network infrastructure devices (routers, switches, firewalls) provide recommendations for configuring these devices to protect the organization's network from external and internal threats.
