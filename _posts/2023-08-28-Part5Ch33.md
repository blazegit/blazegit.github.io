# 5.3 Organizational Policies

# Organizational Policies

Organizational policies are essential guidelines and rules that define how an organization operates, ensuring consistency, security, and compliance across various aspects of its operations.

## Personnel

### Acceptable Use Policy

An **Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)** is a set of guidelines that outline the acceptable and unacceptable behaviors of individuals when utilizing an organization's IT resources. This encompasses the use of computers, networks, and devices. The primary objective is to prevent misuse and security breaches by establishing clear expectations for responsible and secure usage.

### Job Rotation

**Job Rotation** involves systematically moving employees through different roles within an organization. This practice serves to prevent fraud and ensures a separation of duties. By regularly changing responsibilities, the risk of a single individual having excessive control over a critical process is diminished.

### Mandatory Vacation

**Mandatory Vacation Policies** mandate that employees take time off from work at regular intervals. The purpose is to uncover potential fraudulent activities that may remain concealed when an employee is consistently present. It serves as a preventive measure against fraudulent behavior.

### Separation of Duties

**Separation of Duties** entails distributing responsibilities among various individuals to avoid conflicts of interest and mitigate the risk of fraud. This ensures that no single person possesses complete control over a specific process, thereby enhancing accountability and reducing the likelihood of wrongdoing.

### Least Privilege

The **Least Privilege Principle** dictates that employees should be granted only the permissions necessary for their specific job roles. By limiting access to the minimum required level, this principle reduces the risk of unauthorized access and minimizes the potential damage caused by insider threats.

### Clean Desk Space

A **Clean Desk Policy** requires employees to keep their work areas free from sensitive information and documents when not in use. This precautionary measure prevents unauthorized access to confidential materials and safeguards against information breaches.

### Background Checks

**Background Checks** involve screening potential employees to verify their qualifications, criminal history, and suitability for a given role. These checks are essential to ensuring that trustworthy individuals are hired, thereby minimizing the risk of internal threats.

### Nondisclosure Agreement (NDA)

An **NDA (Nondisclosure Agreement)** is a legally binding document that outlines the confidentiality obligations of employees regarding sensitive company information. It acts as a safeguard against the unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets and proprietary information.

### Social Media Analysis

**Social Media Analysis** entails monitoring employees' online activities to ensure they do not engage in behavior that could harm the organization's reputation or compromise security. This policy aims to mitigate risks associated with online behavior.

### Onboarding

**Onboarding Policies** ensure that new employees receive proper training, information, and resources for a smooth integration into the organization. This process helps new hires understand their roles and responsibilities and fosters a sense of belonging within the organization.

### Offboarding

**Offboarding Policies** govern the process of transitioning employees out of the organization. This includes revoking access to systems and recovering company property to prevent any potential security risks posed by former employees.

### User Training

**User Training Policies** mandate that employees undergo regular cybersecurity awareness and training programs. This ensures that employees are equipped to recognize and respond effectively to security threats, enhancing overall organizational security.

## Third-Party Risk Management

### Vendors

**Vendor Risk Management** involves the assessment and management of security risks associated with third-party vendors and suppliers. This ensures that external entities do not pose a threat to the organization's security.

### Supply Chain

**Supply Chain Risk Management** extends risk assessment to partners involved in the production and distribution of goods and services. It aims to identify and mitigate potential risks throughout the supply chain.

### Business Partners

**Business Partner Risk Management** focuses on evaluating the security risks associated with organizations that have business relationships with the company. This includes assessing the cybersecurity posture of partners to ensure overall security.

### Service Level Agreement (SLA)

An **SLA (Service Level Agreement)** outlines the terms and conditions of a service provided by a third party. This agreement ensures clear expectations and performance standards, promoting accountability and transparency.

### Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)

An **MOU (Memorandum of Understanding)** delineates the terms of cooperation between organizations. In the context of cybersecurity, it may include collaborative efforts to enhance security in shared initiatives.

### Measurement Systems Analysis (MSA)

**Measurement Systems Analysis (MSA)** defines the methods and criteria for measuring and assessing risks. This ensures consistency and accuracy in evaluating the potential impact of various risks.

### Business Partnership Agreement (BPA)

A **Business Partnership Agreement (BPA)** outlines the responsibilities, terms, and expectations of a business partnership, including considerations related to cybersecurity. It ensures that cybersecurity is a fundamental aspect of the partnership.

### End of Life (EOL)

**End of Life (EOL) Policies** address the retirement of products and technologies. These policies ensure that decommissioned assets do not pose security risks to the organization, especially when they are no longer receiving updates or support.

### End of Service Life (EOSL)

**End of Service Life (EOSL) Policies** specify the end of service for products or technologies, including the discontinuation of security updates. This policy ensures that the organization is aware of and can address the security implications of using outdated technologies.

### NDA

**NDA Agreements with Third Parties** outline confidentiality requirements for sensitive information shared during collaboration with external entities. This safeguards the organization's proprietary information during collaborative efforts.

## Data

### Classification

**Data Classification Policies** define how different types of data should be labeled and protected based on their sensitivity levels. This helps in ensuring that appropriate security measures are applied to safeguard different categories of data.

### Governance

**Data Governance Policies** establish the processes and responsibilities for managing and protecting data throughout its lifecycle. These policies ensure that data is handled consistently, securely, and in compliance with relevant regulations.

### Retention

**Data Retention Policies** outline how long different types of data should be retained and the secure disposal methods when no longer needed. This prevents the unnecessary storage of data and ensures compliance with data protection regulations.

## Credential Policies

### Personnel

**Personnel Credential Policies** define the rules for creating and managing user accounts, passwords, and access rights for employees. This ensures that access is granted only to authorized individuals and helps in preventing unauthorized access.

### Third Party

**Third-Party Credential Policies** outline how external entities should manage their access credentials when interacting with the organization's systems. This ensures that third parties adhere to security standards and do not compromise the organization's systems.

### Devices

**Device Credential Policies** define the security measures for managing access credentials on devices such as laptops, smartphones, and IoT devices. This ensures that access to devices is secure, minimizing the risk of unauthorized use or data breaches.

### Service Accounts

**Service Account Credential Policies** specify how service accounts used by applications and systems should be managed, including authentication and authorization. This helps in preventing misuse of service accounts and ensures proper access controls.

### Administrator/Root Accounts

**Administrator/Root Credential Policies** define the security controls for managing superuser accounts with elevated privileges. This ensures that access to critical system components is tightly controlled and monitored to prevent unauthorized actions.

## Organizational Policies

### Change Management

**Change Management Policies** define the

 process for introducing and managing changes to IT systems and infrastructure. The aim is to minimize disruptions and security risks associated with system changes, ensuring a controlled and secure environment.

### Change Control

**Change Control Policies** outline the procedures and controls for reviewing, approving, and implementing changes to systems and processes. This ensures that changes are implemented in a controlled and secure manner, minimizing the risk of unintended consequences.
