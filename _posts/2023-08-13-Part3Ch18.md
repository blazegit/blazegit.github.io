## Endpoint Protection

### Antivirus

Antivirus software is designed to detect, prevent, and remove malicious software, often referred to as viruses, from computer systems and devices. It scans files, programs, and data to identify patterns or behaviors associated with known threats. Antivirus solutions help safeguard endpoints from a range of malicious software, including viruses, worms, Trojans, and more.

### Anti-Malware

Anti-malware software extends protection beyond viruses to include a broader spectrum of malicious software, or malware. This includes threats like spyware (which spies on user activities), adware (which displays unwanted ads), and various types of Trojans (which disguise themselves as legitimate software). Anti-malware tools provide comprehensive defense against a wider array of digital threats.

### Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)

EDR solutions are advanced security tools that monitor endpoints (such as computers and devices) for suspicious activities and potential threats. They analyze events in real-time, detecting unusual behaviors and patterns that may indicate a cyberattack or compromise. EDR systems offer insights into the scope and impact of incidents, facilitating effective incident response and threat mitigation.

### DLP

Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions focus on safeguarding sensitive information from unauthorized access, sharing, or leakage. These tools monitor data flows and communications to prevent confidential data from being transferred to unauthorized users or locations. DLP can be particularly crucial for protecting sensitive corporate, customer, or personal information.

### Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)

Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs) are advanced firewall systems that go beyond traditional firewall functionalities. They offer intrusion prevention, application awareness, and deep packet inspection capabilities. NGFWs analyze network traffic at a more granular level, enabling them to identify and block not only known threats but also new and sophisticated attack methods.

### Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS)

HIDS monitors the activities on a single host (such as a computer or server) for signs of unauthorized or malicious behavior. It analyzes system logs, files, and other relevant data to identify anomalies or suspicious patterns that could indicate a security breach. HIDS serves as an important layer of defense for individual endpoints.

### Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS)

HIPS builds on HIDS capabilities by not only detecting but also actively preventing unauthorized activities on a host. It takes immediate actions to block or restrict activities that match predefined security rules. HIPS enhances security by intervening in real-time to halt potentially harmful actions.

### Host-based Firewall

A host-based firewall is a software-based firewall that resides on an individual device or endpoint. It monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic to determine which communications are allowed and which are blocked. This provides an added layer of defense by controlling the network connections specific to that device.

## Boot Integrity

### Boot Security/Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)

UEFI, or Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, is a modern replacement for BIOS (Basic Input/Output System). UEFI provides enhanced security during the boot process by supporting secure boot mechanisms. Secure boot ensures that the system boots using only authorized and digitally signed components, helping prevent malware or unauthorized code from executing during startup.

### Measured Boot

Measured Boot is a security feature that records the integrity measurements of various boot components. These measurements are stored in a secure log, allowing later verification of the boot process's trustworthiness. Measured Boot helps identify changes or compromises to the boot sequence that could indicate unauthorized alterations.

### Boot Attestation

Boot attestation involves verifying and attesting to the integrity of the boot process. This process ensures that the system starts securely and has not been tampered with. Boot attestation generates a trusted report or evidence that the boot process followed security protocols and used authorized components.

## Database

### Tokenization

Tokenization is a method for protecting sensitive data by replacing it with unique tokens. These tokens serve as placeholders for the actual data. Tokenization allows systems to process transactions and operations using the tokens while keeping the original sensitive information secure. It is commonly used for payment card data and other sensitive information.

### Salting
Salting is a security practice used in password storage. When storing passwords, a random value (the salt) is added to each password before hashing. This randomization prevents attackers from using precomputed tables (rainbow tables) to quickly crack passwords, as each salted password generates a unique hash.

### Hashing
Hashing is a process that transforms input data, such as a password or a file, into a fixed-length string of characters. Hashing is a one-way function, meaning it is difficult to reverse and retrieve the original input from the hash value. Hashes are commonly used to ensure data integrity and to securely store passwords in databases. Even a small change in the input data results in a significantly different hash value.


## Application Security

### Input Validations

Input validations ensure that data entered by users is checked for correctness and safety. These checks are crucial for preventing various attacks, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS), that can exploit vulnerabilities in the application's input fields. By implementing robust input validations, applications can mitigate the risk of malicious inputs compromising the system's integrity and security.

### Secure Cookies

Secure cookies enhance the security of web applications by implementing additional measures to protect sensitive information stored in cookies. The "Secure" attribute ensures that cookies are transmitted only over encrypted (HTTPS) connections, preventing unauthorized access during data transmission. The "HttpOnly" attribute restricts cookie access from client-side scripts, reducing the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks that aim to steal sensitive information.

### Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Headers

HTTP headers play a vital role in enhancing the security of web applications. Headers like Content Security Policy (CSP) define policies for loading resources, thereby preventing malicious content from being executed on the web page. Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is another header that enforces the use of HTTPS, ensuring secure communication between the client and the server, and reducing the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Code Signing

Code signing involves digitally signing software using cryptographic techniques to verify the authenticity and integrity of the code. This process helps users trust the source of the code and ensures that the code has not been tampered with or altered by malicious actors. Code signing is crucial in establishing trust and maintaining the integrity of software applications, especially when distributing software over the internet or through other channels.

### Allow List

An allow list, also known as a whitelist, enumerates approved elements or actions that are deemed safe for the application. By allowing only known and trusted entities, the allow list minimizes the potential entry points for malicious inputs or actions. Implementing an allow list helps prevent unauthorized access and reduces the risk of unauthorized activities within the application.

### Block List/Deny List

A block list, or deny list, identifies disallowed entities, actions, or inputs that are considered unsafe or potentially harmful for the application. By blocking known vulnerabilities or malicious inputs, the block list reduces the attack surface and prevents unauthorized activities or actions that could compromise the application's security.

### Secure Coding Practices

Secure coding practices guide developers in writing code that prioritizes security. By following established secure coding guidelines and best practices, developers can avoid common vulnerabilities and adopt coding patterns that enhance the application's overall security posture. Secure coding practices help build robust and secure applications that are less susceptible to exploitation and attacks.

### Static Code Analysis

Static code analysis tools review the source code without execution, identifying potential vulnerabilities and code quality issues. These tools assist developers in detecting security flaws, coding errors, and other issues early in the development cycle, allowing them to address these issues before the application is deployed. Static code analysis is a crucial part of the development process, helping to improve the overall security and reliability of the application.

### Dynamic Code Analysis

Dynamic code analysis tools test applications during runtime, uncovering vulnerabilities that may only manifest while the software is operational. These tools simulate real-world scenarios and monitor the application's behavior, identifying potential security weaknesses and vulnerabilities that may not be apparent during static analysis. Dynamic code analysis helps ensure that the application remains secure and stable during actual usage and operation.

### Fuzzing

Fuzzing is a technique that involves systematically bombarding an application with unexpected, invalid, or random inputs to identify vulnerabilities, crashes, or unexpected behavior that attackers could exploit. By subjecting the application to various types of input data, developers can uncover potential weaknesses and security issues that may not have been identified during normal testing. Fuzzing is an essential part of the security testing process, helping to identify and address vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors.


## Hardening

### Open Ports and Services

When hardening an application, the focus is on minimizing its vulnerabilities. Open ports and services refer to the network access points and software functionalities that allow data to pass through a network. Hardening in this context involves closing unnecessary open ports and disabling unused services to limit potential attack entry points, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access or exploitation.

### Registry

The Windows Registry is a hierarchical database that stores configuration settings and options for the operating system and various applications. Registry hardening involves securing the Windows Registry by configuring permissions and settings. This process prevents unauthorized changes that could expose the system to vulnerabilities, ensuring that only authorized users can access and modify critical system settings.

### Disk Encryption

Disk encryption protects data at rest by encrypting the entire disk or specific partitions. This security measure ensures that even if physical storage devices are compromised or stolen, the data remains confidential and inaccessible to unauthorized individuals. Disk encryption makes it extremely difficult for attackers to access sensitive information from the physical storage medium without the encryption key.

### OS

Operating system hardening involves configuring the operating system to minimize security risks. This process includes implementing security controls, disabling unused or unnecessary features, and applying security patches to address any known vulnerabilities. The goal is to create a more secure environment that is less susceptible to cyber threats and attacks.

### Patch Management

Patch management is the practice of regularly updating software to address known vulnerabilities and improve security. By staying up-to-date with the latest patches and updates, organizations can effectively mitigate potential security risks and reduce the likelihood of successful cyber attacks that exploit known vulnerabilities in the software.

### Third-Party Updates

Updating third-party software is crucial to prevent vulnerabilities in components from being exploited by attackers. Since third-party software is often integrated into various systems, ensuring that it is regularly updated helps to maintain a secure environment and minimize the risk of potential security breaches.

### Auto-Update

Auto-update mechanisms enable software to automatically receive security updates, reducing the risk of using outdated and vulnerable versions. This feature is crucial in maintaining the security and integrity of software systems, as it ensures that critical security patches and updates are applied in a timely manner without requiring manual intervention from users or administrators.

## Self-Encrypting Drive (SED)/Full Disk Encryption (FDE)

### Opal

Opal is a standard for self-encrypting drives (SEDs) that provides a consistent method to manage and use hardware-based encryption for data protection. It helps ensure that data stored on the drive remains secure and inaccessible to unauthorized users, even if the drive is removed or stolen. The Opal standard helps establish a secure and reliable encryption framework for protecting sensitive information on storage devices.

## Hardware Root of Trust

A hardware root of trust establishes a secure foundation for a system using trusted hardware components. These components, such as cryptographic modules or secure boot mechanisms, play a crucial role in enhancing the security of the system by providing a trusted and secure environment for key operations and sensitive data storage. The hardware root of trust is essential in building a secure foundation that can be relied upon for critical security functions and operations.

## Trusted Platform Module (TPM)

TPM is a hardware-based security module that stores cryptographic keys, enabling secure authentication and providing a basis for secure system operations. It is used to ensure the integrity of the system and protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or tampering. TPM helps in establishing a trusted environment for various security-related tasks, such as secure boot, disk encryption, and digital rights management, among others.

## Sandboxing

Sandboxing is a security mechanism that isolates applications or processes within a controlled environment. This controlled environment limits the impact of malicious code by containing it from affecting the wider system or network. Sandboxing helps in identifying and analyzing potentially harmful software behavior without risking the overall security and integrity of the system. It is commonly used to test untrusted programs or to provide an additional layer of security for web browsing, email attachments, and other potentially risky activities.
