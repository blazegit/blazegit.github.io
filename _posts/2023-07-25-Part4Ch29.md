# Chapter 29: Mitigation Techniques and Controls

## Reconfigure Endpoint Security Solutions

### Application Approved List
An application approved list, also known as an application whitelist, specifies which applications are allowed to run on endpoints. Reconfiguring endpoint security solutions to enforce an approved list helps prevent unauthorized or malicious software from executing.

### Application Blocklist/Deny List
An application blocklist, also known as an application deny list, identifies applications that are prohibited from running on endpoints. Reconfiguring endpoint security solutions to enforce a blocklist helps prevent known malicious or vulnerable applications from being executed.

### Quarantine
Quarantine involves isolating potentially compromised endpoints or devices from the network. By reconfiguring endpoint security solutions, organizations can trigger automatic quarantine when suspicious activity is detected, preventing the spread of threats.

## Configuration Changes

### Firewall Rules
Adjusting firewall rules involves configuring network firewalls to block or allow specific types of traffic. By reconfiguring firewall rules, organizations can restrict unauthorized network access and better control the flow of data.

### MDM (Mobile Device Management)
Mobile Device Management tools allow organizations to remotely manage and configure mobile devices. Reconfiguring MDM settings can enforce security policies, restrict device capabilities, and ensure compliance with organizational standards.

### DLP (Data Loss Prevention)
Reconfiguring DLP solutions involves setting up policies to monitor and control the movement of sensitive data. This can prevent data leaks by blocking unauthorized transfers or notifying administrators when policy violations occur.

### Content Filter/URL Filter
Content filters or URL filters restrict access to specific websites or content categories. Reconfiguring these filters helps organizations prevent users from accessing malicious or inappropriate websites.

### Update or Revoke Certificates
Reconfiguring certificates involves updating or revoking digital certificates used for authentication and encryption. This ensures that only authorized entities can establish secure connections.

## Isolation

Isolation involves separating compromised or potentially compromised systems from the rest of the network. This prevents threats from spreading and gives security teams time to assess and mitigate the situation.

## Containment

Containment focuses on limiting the impact of a security incident. By isolating affected systems, disabling compromised accounts, or suspending suspicious activities, organizations can prevent further harm.

## Segmentation

Network segmentation involves dividing a network into smaller segments or zones. Reconfiguring network segments with appropriate security controls limits lateral movement for attackers and contains the impact of security incidents.

## Secure Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)

### Runbooks
Runbooks are predefined sets of procedures and tasks that guide incident responders through specific actions. By implementing SOAR solutions and creating runbooks, organizations can automate and streamline incident response processes.

### Playbooks
Playbooks in SOAR platforms provide more advanced automation capabilities. They combine multiple steps and decision points to orchestrate complex incident response actions, making the process faster and more efficient.
