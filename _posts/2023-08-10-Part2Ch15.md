### Electronic
Electronic locks utilize digital technology for locking and unlocking mechanisms. They can be controlled remotely, integrated with access control systems, and offer features like time-based access restrictions and audit trails to enhance security and convenience.

### Physical
Physical locks are traditional locks that rely on mechanical mechanisms, such as keys or combination dials, to secure doors and objects. They are widely used and can vary in complexity and security levels.

### Cable Locks
Cable locks are flexible security devices made of a cable and a locking mechanism. They are often used to secure items like bicycles, laptops, or equipment. Cable locks offer portability and versatility, allowing users to fasten items to fixed structures.

## USB Data Blocker
A USB data blocker, also known as a USB condom, is a device that prevents data exchange between a device and a USB port. It allows for safe charging without the risk of data theft or malware transmission, making it useful in public charging stations.

## Lighting
Lighting refers to the illumination of indoor or outdoor spaces. In the context of security, proper lighting can deter intruders, enhance surveillance, and improve visibility, reducing the likelihood of accidents and unauthorized access.

## Fencing
Fencing involves the installation of barriers, often made of materials like metal or wood, to enclose and protect an area. Fencing can serve as a physical boundary to deter unauthorized entry and enhance security around properties or sensitive locations.
